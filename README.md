# :books: Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks created during study sessions in interest topics. 

They are a way of creating a comprehensive reference library that can be used personally. 

While writing the first ones I also realized they are an awesome way to focus on the subject and to go deep into details. This is an important benefit since technology studies are always broad and we tend to lose focus and take unexpected paths.
